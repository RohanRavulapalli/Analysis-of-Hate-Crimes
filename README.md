# Analysis-of-Hate-Crimes

Undergraduate group project aiming to provide insights to determine the most efficient predictors of national level hate crime, persuade the significance of the issues relating to hate crime and employ strategies for controlling overall crime rates. Project involved analyzing CSV crime data in R and producing appropriate graphical summaries such as MDS (Multi-dimensional scaling) plots, bar plots, and scatter plots. This repository contains the project slideshow, as well as the R code behind the bar plot of state crime variation, which was one of the visualizations made in the project. 

"Analysis of Hate Crimes.pptx.pdf" contains the entire project slideshow, including all qualitiative and quantitative insights produced. "State Crime Vartion.R" contains specifically the bar plot code. It should be noted that in order to view the entire pdf slideshow, you may need to continously click the "More Pages" button.
